Fluency-LEAP Correlation Analysis - Error Log
==============================================
Run date: 2026-02-22 (run-07)

1. DIBELS VIEW ACCESS DENIED
   Table: fls-data-warehouse.fluency.dibels_data_combined_acl (VIEW)
   Error: "Access Denied: BigQuery BigQuery: Permission denied while getting Drive credentials."
   Impact: Cannot query the DIBELS benchmark combined view directly.
   Workaround: Used amplify_benchmark_results_2024_2025 table instead, which contains
   DIBELS 8th Edition Composite_Score data. Correlations computed via amplify_leap_corr.json.

2. DIBELS PM TABLE (dibels_pm_data_combined_acl)
   This table was accessible but contains progress monitoring probe-level data,
   not benchmark composite scores. Not suitable for LEAP correlation analysis.

3. ORF Combined View - School_Year type
   The orf_data_combined view has School_Year as a mixed INT64/STRING type depending
   on the underlying source. Used SAFE_CAST(School_Year AS INT64) = 2024 to handle both.

4. Grade 3 and 4 ORF-LEAP join note
   Grade 3: Only 22 matched records (low N for correlation).
   Grade 4: Only 33 matched records. ORF coverage shows very few grade 4 students
   in the orf_data_combined view (only 33 total across schools), likely because
   grade 4 ORF is only captured for a subset or specific schools. AIMSWeb has better
   grade 4 coverage (269+ students across schools for Fall benchmark).
