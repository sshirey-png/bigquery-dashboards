Cross-Year Replication for 22-23:

DEAD END: 22-23 anet-LEAP correlation is NOT possible.
Reason: anet tables only go back to 23-24 (ela_boy_23_24, math_boy_23_24).
LEAP data exists for 22-23 (399001-399005), but there is no corresponding assessment data to correlate with.

easyCBM dataset:
DEAD END: Dataset fls-data-warehouse:easycbm not found. Tried easycbm, easy_cbm, easyCBM variants.

ORF Cross-Year Notes:
- School_Year coding in fluency.orf_data_combined is ambiguous. EntryDate/ExitDate appear to be current enrollment dates, not test dates.
- Tested both School_Year=2023 and 2024 against LEAP 23-24:
  - School_Year=2023 matched 786 students: r_eoy=0.648, r_boy=0.625
  - School_Year=2024 matched 1275 students: r_eoy=0.579, r_boy=0.584
- Used School_Year=2024 for the primary orf_crossyear_corr.json since it had broader coverage (1,275+ matches vs 786).
- Both show stable ORF-LEAP ELA correlations in the 0.55-0.65 range across years.

SocialScaleScore Notes:
- SocialScaleScore was NULL for all 23-24 LEAP records when correlated with anet BOY.
- This is consistent across all 4 schools (Ashe, Green, LHA, Wheatley).
- Social Studies LEAP may not have been administered in 23-24, or data was not loaded.
